      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>I first discovered my interest in Cyber Security when I was exploring the intersection of technology and problem-solving. Studying Cyber Security at <strong>Glasgow Caledonian University</strong> allowed me to delve deep into network defenses, ethical hacking, and digital forensics, building not only technical skills but also a passion for helping others understand the importance of protecting their online space.</p>
      <p>But learning doesn't stop in the classroom! I've had the chance to apply my knowledge and grow my skill set through various roles:</p>

      <ul class="experience-list">
        <li>
          <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i>
          <strong>Student Outreach Mentor</strong> - Guided and mentored fellow students, helping them navigate university life while fostering a sense of community.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i class="fa fa-futbol"></i>
          <strong>Football Steward</strong> - A role that taught me responsibility and working under pressure, ensuring safety at large events.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i class="fa fa-shield-alt"></i>
          <strong>Ethical Hacking Treasurer</strong> - Managed the finances of the ethical hacking club, supporting events that brought hackers and security enthusiasts together.

    <div class="hobbies">
      <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
      <p>Outside of my studies, I have a few hobbies that keep me creative and strategic. I'm a huge fan of <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> and <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong>, where I get to challenge my thinking and build strategies in the most fun ways possible. These hobbies keep my mind sharp and creativeâ€”skills I believe are just as important in cyber security as they are in card games!</p>
