    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm a passionate and driven individual with a strong background in <strong>Cyber Security</strong> and <strong>Computer Networks</strong>. During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in various roles and activities that have not only shaped my skills but also deepened my love for the tech world.</p>

    <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
    <p>At <strong>Glasgow Caledonian University</strong>, I pursued a degree in <em>Cyber Security</em> and <em>Computer Networks</em>, where I developed a solid foundation in protecting systems and networks from potential threats. My time at university was filled with hands-on experience and learning, helping me understand the ever-evolving nature of the cyber world.</p>

    <h2>Extra-Curricular Engagements</h2>
    <p>In addition to my academic studies, I got involved in various activities that helped me grow as a person and a professional:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Student Outreach Mentor:</strong> As a mentor at Glasgow Caledonian University, I had the privilege of helping students navigate their academic journey, providing advice and support to those who needed it the most.</li>
      <li><strong>Football Steward:</strong> A role that kept me active and engaged with the community, ensuring a safe and enjoyable environment during football matches.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical Hacking Treasurer:</strong> I took on the responsibility of managing finances for the ethical hacking club, working alongside like-minded individuals to organize events and workshops.</li>
      <li><strong>Cyber Clinic Volunteer:</strong> Volunteering at the university's Cyber Clinic allowed me to assist local businesses and individuals with their cyber security needs, offering practical advice and solutions to real-world problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>When I'm not diving into the world of tech and security, you'll often find me indulging in my hobbies. I’m an avid player of <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> and <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh</strong>, two games that challenge my strategic thinking and keep me on my toes. Whether it's building decks or battling friends, these games bring out my competitive side in the best way!</p>

    <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
    <p>I'm eager to take everything I've learned and put it into practice in a <strong>cyber security</strong> or <strong>networking</strong> role. I’m particularly interested in securing and defending networks against cyber threats, and I am actively seeking <strong>entry-level job roles</strong> where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute to the field.</p>
