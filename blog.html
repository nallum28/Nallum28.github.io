       <h3>The Cybersecurity Room: A Digital Investigation Unfolds</h3>
    <p>The event revolved around a <strong>murder mystery</strong> with <strong>five suspects</strong>, each with potential motives and hidden connections to the victim. In my room, students became part of the digital investigation. I <strong>projected my screen</strong> to the room, demonstrating <strong>OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)</strong> techniques and <strong>password cracking</strong> in real time.</p>

    <p>While I led the technical investigation, the students weren’t just passive observers—they <strong>interacted at various points</strong>, contributing ideas, making observations, and helping to piece together the clues. Their input was key as we uncovered <strong>private messages</strong> between the suspect and victim, providing <strong>critical evidence</strong> for the courtroom portion of the day.</p>

    <h3>From Concept to Execution</h3>
    <p>Creating this experience required <strong>close collaboration with the overall lead</strong> and the <strong>scriptwriter</strong> responsible for the day’s narrative. We worked together to ensure that the cybersecurity portion <strong>fit seamlessly into the storyline</strong>, while keeping the techniques realistic but accessible for the <strong>14-16 year old audience</strong>. The goal was to make it educational, engaging, and slightly cinematic—giving students a glimpse into how digital investigations are conducted.</p>

    <h3>Impact and Reflections</h3>
    <p>Watching the students engage with the <strong>cybersecurity process</strong>—from spotting key details to reacting to the unfolding evidence—was incredibly rewarding. Their curiosity and willingness to participate highlighted just how <strong>impactful hands-on, immersive learning</strong> can be.</p>

    <p>Returning to the outreach office afterward, I reflected on how this event came together so quickly after the <strong>school visit</strong>. It was a reminder of how <strong>spontaneous opportunities</strong> can lead to some of the most memorable experiences. The chance to <strong>showcase cybersecurity skills</strong> in an interactive format, while collaborating with creative leads, was a highlight—and hopefully, it sparked some interest in <strong>tech and digital forensics</strong> among the students.</p>
